## 1. Project Overview
Objective: Predict whether a customer will reorder a specific product based on historical order patterns using Machine Learning.

Dataset: Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset, contains 3+ million grocery orders.

## 2. Problem Statement
Many users reorder the same products regularly.

The goal is to identify such patterns and predict future reorders to improve customer experience and inventory planning.
